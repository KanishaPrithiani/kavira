  <h1 class="about-heading">Welcome to <span class="brand">Kavira</span> 💚</h1>

  <p class="about-intro">
    Kavira is not just a gifting store — it's a feeling.
We craft curated gift combos that celebrate memories, emotions, and meaningful connections.<br> Whether it’s a birthday, a celebration, or a simple “thinking of you” — Kavira helps you say it with style and soul.<br>Kavira was born from the simple idea that gifts should feel like hugs — warm, intentional, and unforgettable.<br> We saw a gap in the market where everything felt mass-produced, rushed, and disconnected.<br> So we decided to bring back the charm of meaningful gifting, with a touch of cuteness and aesthetic love. 🌸
